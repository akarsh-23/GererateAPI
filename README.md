# Application README

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the application architecture and the services used to support it. It also explains the rationale behind using AWS Cognito, AWS CodeDeploy for blue-green deployment, and AWS WAF for API rate limiting.

## Architecture Diagram

## Services Used

### AWS Cognito

AWS Cognito is used in this application for user authentication and authorization. It provides a simple and secure way to manage user identities, allowing you to add sign-up, sign-in, and access control functionalities to your application without the need for building a custom authentication system. By using Cognito, you can offload the complexity of user management, including password storage, login, and security, to a managed service.

### AWS CodeDeploy

AWS CodeDeploy is utilized in this application for blue-green deployment. Blue-green deployment is a release management strategy that reduces downtime during the deployment process. With CodeDeploy, you can automate the deployment of your application to ECS, making it easier to release new features, rollback to previous versions, and perform canary deployments. Blue-green deployment helps ensure zero-downtime deployments and allows for easy rollback in case of any issues with the new release.

### AWS WAF

AWS WAF is used for API rate limiting in this application. API rate limiting is a technique used to control and limit the number of requests made to an API within a specific time frame. With AWS WAF, you can define rules and conditions to filter or block requests that exceed the allowed rate limit, protecting your API from abuse, excessive traffic, and potential DDoS attacks. AWS WAF provides a firewall that can be integrated with your API Gateway or load balancer to enforce rate limits and protect your application from unauthorized or malicious requests.

## Conclusion

The combination of AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization, AWS CodeDeploy for blue-green deployment, and AWS WAF for API rate limiting enhances the security, scalability, and reliability of your application. These services provide managed solutions that offload complex tasks and allow you to focus on developing and delivering your application's core features.
